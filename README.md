This game must be completed in under 10 hours.


Hour 1 - Planning + Design setup

Theme is roll the dice


D&D?

game where you have to take a lot of risks!

whole idea of the game is to balance risk.
DECISION MAKING GAME

Turnbased?

I think of thirdworld farmer type game.


you play as a king who has to defend against the demon lord?


you never know when a wave will come

you can summon heros, but they can die and they cost a lot.

you must also manage the basic resources of the country.

areas that have weakness will fall more easily.

ITS A MAP BASED GAME. you sit in the capital and send orders to parts of the map.

enemy comes from one direction?

every time you make a decision its a dice roll to see the outcome
you get info like - what dice you need to roll and the   required roll + outcomes

basic idea

you are the leader of a nation in the world , you have to determine how to run your nation, balance spending and make decisions that help you win the war.

Turn Based.

Every turn there is a chance that the enemy army mobilises (ie will attack on the next turn)

you have income each turn from your taxes. these fluctuate with the stability and development of each reigon. 

low food produciton has huge impact on stability.

ok i have an idea




TODO : 
- make basic tileset for ally and enemy terrain --DONE
- create sprites for basic units, hero, forest, mountain --DONE
- create tile system, allow for clicking of tile and selecting things. 
- allow for units to be moved
- have cities be objects with requirements, creat stability and taxes indicator.
- allow for tile to be captured, capturing a tile has requirements.
- allow for allocation of spending. 
    -- this will require allowing city to have needs, and ability to grow in development - allow for village to grow to city if enough development.
    

there are some provinces, using FMA type naming
